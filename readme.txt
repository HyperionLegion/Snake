Ok bro here is the tea
Welcome to Snake. Authors: Joshua Hsueh and Bowen Zhang.
This is just like any Snake game. You spawn as a 2-block length snake, trying to grow bigger.
You grow bigger by eating (moving over) the apple that randomly spawns in the game. Once you eat the apple,
another one spawns in another location. Sounds pretty easy, but you have to avoid hitting the walls or else you will die.
Additionally, avoid running your head into another part of your snake body. You can move by using the controls:
left, right, up, and down arrow keys. Press space to pause/resume the game or start a new game. Each time your score will be
compared to your high score for that session, and the highest score is displayed at the top. Try to beat it every time!
